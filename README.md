# Simple Blockchain System

This project implements a simple blockchain system to ensure secure data transactions and protect data integrity in a dataset.

## Features
- Blockchain-based data integrity protection.
- Secure data transactions using cryptographic hashing.
- Validation of blockchain to detect tampering.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Run the `blockchain.py` script to initialize the blockchain and test its functionality.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pandas library

## Files
- `blockchain.py`: Contains the blockchain implementation.
- `data.csv`: Example dataset to demonstrate data integrity protection.
